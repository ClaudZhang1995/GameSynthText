research, developments, and applications.
PRESENTATIONS: Presentations are solicited on all aspects of 
Navy-related scientific visualization and virtual reality.  All 
current work, works-in-progress, and proposed work by Navy 
organizations will be considered.  Four types of presentations are 
available.

        attend the seminar)
     4. Scientific visualization or virtual reality demonstration (BYOH)
Accepted presentations will not be published in any proceedings, 
however, viewgraphs and other materials will be reproduced for 
seminar attendees.
ABSTRACTS: Authors should submit a one page abstract and/or videotape to:
     Robert Lipman

gnuplot, etc. make it easy to plot real valued functions of 2 variables
but I want to plot functions whose values are 2-vectors. I have been 
doing this by plotting arrays of arrows (complete with arrowheads) but
before going further, I thought I would ask whether someone has already
done the work. Any pointers??
thanx in advance

>Can someone please tell me where I can ftp DTA or DMORPH?
DMorf (Dave's Morph, I think is what it means) and DTax (Dave's 
TGA Assembler) are available in the MSDOS_UPLOADS directory
on the wuarchive.
They are arjed and bundled with their respective xmemory versions,
dmorfx.exe and dtax.exe, you can also find a version of aaplay.exe
there, with which you can view files you create with dta.exe or
dtax.exe.
I downloaded the whole bunch last week and have been morphing 
away the afternoons since.  The programmes are all a bit buggy and
definitely not-ready-to-spread-to-the-masses, but they are very
well written. 
The interface is frustrating at first, but it gets easy once you
figure out the tricks.
I have noticed that dmorfx will crash horribly if you try to morph
without using the splines option.  Not sure why, since I don't have
the source.  I think it was written for TP 6.0.
If anyone else comes up with any other hints on getting the thing 
to work right, tell me; it took me several hours the first time
just to figure out that if I just used the durned splines then 
it would work...

Hello,
     I am looking to add voice input capability to a user interface I am
developing on an HP730 (UNIX) workstation.  I would greatly appreciate 
information anyone would care to offer about voice input systems that are 
easily accessible from the UNIX environment. 
     The names or adresses of applicable vendors, as well as any 
experiences you have had with specific systems, would be very helpful.
     Please respond via email; I will post a summary if there is 
sufficient interest.
Thanks,
Ken
P.S.  I have found several impressive systems for IBM PC's, but I would 
like to avoid the hassle of purchasing and maintaining a separate PC if 
at all possible.

        I recently got a file describing a library of rendering routines 
called SIPP (SImple Polygon Processor).  Could anyone tell me where I can 
FTP the source code and which is the newest version around?
        Also, I've never used Renderman so I was wondering if Renderman 
is like SIPP?  ie. a library of rendering routines which one uses to make 
a program that creates the image...
                                        Thanks,  Joe Tham

    While I don't mean to damn Henrik's attempt to be helpful here,
he's using a common misconception that should be corrected.
    Mach banding will occur for any image.  It is not the color
quantization you see when you don't have enough bits.  It is the
human eye's response to transitions or edges between intensities.
The result is that colors near the transistion look brighter on
the brighter side and darker on the darker side.
